It is the language used to develop apps for macOS, iOS, WatchOS. It is gaining quite popular as it is easier to read, maintain. It is quite faster, safer, and requires fewer lines of code. It was designed to reduce the gap between the human mind and computer operations which is why syntax-wise, swift is pretty easy, and usually, in 3-4 months, you can start with developing apps. Currently, it is in high demand and the average salary expected is between 4-10 lakhs per annum.
