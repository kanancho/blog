## All About Google Stadia

Google recently announced their gaming service called Stadia and, in this article, we would be discussing all what is it and how it can revolutionize the gaming industry. Using this platform one can play on a Phone, Tablet, Laptop, Chromebook, or even your TV. The company hasn’t yet announced the game titles that you’ll be able to play on Stadia but they would be available later on this year.
 
Google is partnering with AMD to build GPU for data centers. The Chip will deliver a blazing 10.7 teraflops which is more than 4.2 teraflops off PS4 Pro and 6 teraflops of Xbox One X. Each Stadia will be powered by a custom 2.7 GHz x86 processor with 16GB of Ram. So, you will be able to play games up to 4K at 60 FPS with HDR and surround sound and they are planning to go up to 8K at 120 FPS. Basically, the way that it works is the games are directly streamed from the Google Data Centre to your device. 

So, there is no hardware involved but even though there is no actual physical hardware, Google is releasing their own controller that can be used with a phone or laptop and they call it Stadia Controller as it looks like a standard controller but it has a couple of special buttons. One, there is a Google Assistant button and this button is a little bit different because you actually use google assistant for helping you with any game that you’re playing. So, if there’s a level you are stuck on you can actually ask Google assistant to help you with that particular level.

The other button is a capture button that lets you share your gaming directly to YouTube. Google also mentioned Stadia will support cross-play and multiplayer and there’s also a lot of integration with YouTube and one of the coolest features is something called Crowd Play and what crowd play will allow you is to join your favorite streamers and play with them while they are streaming live on YouTube, So, there’s actually be a link on there stream that you can click on and it automatically put you some queue or line to join their lobby and play with them in a particular game which I think is going to be very pretty cool.

> This is your gateway to the best of Stadia. It enables you to access the full Stadia experience and there are many advantages to the Stadia controller and first is that it will connect through Wi-Fi directly to the game that is running in the Google Data Centre. The Stadia controller identifies on which screen you want to play and links it with your game session running in the cloud ensuring that the highest possible performance and the best experience for players

With the new technology called State Share, developers can let a player instantly share a playable moment from a game. This could include the world state, player’s position, items they are carrying, or anything the developers want to pack into a shareable moment. The game state can be encoded into a link that tells Stadia where to pick up the game. This could be sent to one player or it could be shared on YouTube.

Google hasn’t talked about a lot of the game titles that might be on Stadia, a couple of games that we know is going to be Assassin’s Creed Odyssey which if you remember is the game that they beta tested a few months ago with their project Stream and another game is Doom Eternal. They also mentioned their own game studio called Stadia Games and Entertainment. They’re going to develop their own first-party games and they also partnered with a bunch of companies. Right now, it’s a very small list some of the most notable ones are like Unreal and Unity but this list is going to growing with time as goes on but as far as Stadia is going to be available in four Countries US, UK, Canada, and Europe
