So, it’s a common problem that our devices hang while operating.
Let’s understand! 

What actually happens is that our devices get overloaded and sometimes overheated.
Thermal Throttling is the condition when a device gets overheated and to protect the device, the operating system of the device freezes the current state of the device to protect further damage to the devices. This mostly occurs when you are gaming at high graphics or medium depending on your system configuration. But it is mostly seen when you are doing some heavy task and the configuration of the system is not that good.
The frequency of CPU decreases and frame drops and eventually the GPU focuses on removing heat and therefore a good cooling system is a must for every device.

In most cases, the cooling system is either of cheap quality or not properly set up. If you are using a system with an i3 or Pentium processor then you need not worry about any specific cooling unit. A cooling fan would be enough with a clean and airy environment but in a higher configuration problem starts. A system with i5 or i7 configuration would require more power. Mostly in these configurations, a GPU is also supported (Read more about GPU) which produces maximum heat during gaming.

So, what’s the solution?

- If you are using a smartphone with a removable battery, then you can easily remove the battery though it has a very high chance of data loss in this situation, this is the only solution.

- If you are using a smartphone with a non-removable battery then just hold the power button until the display is off and after 2-3 minutes power on your smartphone.

- If you are using a laptop then firstly press the num lock key 2-3 times to ensure that the operating system is not responding or the whole laptop is not. In any of the cases, hold the power button of the device until the screen shutdowns.

If these methods don’t work, immediately contact your nearest service center ASAP.
