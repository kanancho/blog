In the era of the internet and virtualization, everything is available on the internet openly and free. Here I am going to give a list of the top 10 sites that I personally use which are absolutely free and can be helpful for your daily life problems.

This website is a collection of all e-books in all fields from technology to novels, art, biography, fiction and literature, health and fitness. It basically has all e-books available from all folks of life. The main advantage of this website is that it offers “Unlimited downloads” and ad-free service. If you are curious about reading or bookworm them you should definitely give it a try to this website.

- **Remove background**
If you are photogenic or you are a photographer, you must have faced problems with the background of the picture or you want a different background, then you will definitely love this website. Just upload a photograph with a clear vision of the profile and under 5-10 seconds the background will vanish and now output can be transferred. Without the use of heavy software like Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom you can get your desired image.

- **Paste Bin**
Now, this website is mostly used by developers to share code as it is in form of a single link. But it can also be used by students to share their project work. You can also set an expiration time for the link to self-destruct. All the data stored is encrypted and every time you open the link it asks for human verification. This is completely safe.

Don’t judge this website by its name. It basically provides a peer-to-peer transfer service in which the file is transferred from the sender browser to the client browser without any intermediate server.
