I am going to share my IMC 2018 experience which took place on 25th to 27th October 2018 in Aerocity Delhi. I registered for this event a month before because these of types were restricted to other nations only. Events like Computex, IFA Berlin, CES, MWC and so on are IMC inspiration and aims to bring in more audience by 2020. In 2018, around 65k people attended this mega event. I went to this event on 27th with all my techy friends and one of them especially took a flight to Delhi to attend this event. The event event venue was magficinat and all technologies were displayed there. The main theme of the event was 5G and for trial purposes, they gave 5G wifi access to everybody there! That was so amazing,

I had some data to be uploaded on Google drive and it uploaded so fast that I couldn’t run a speed test. It was so fast! We got to interact with Samsung RND head worldwide and he explained us the backend behind the product displayed.
