> GirlScript Summer of Code is the 3 month-long Open Source program conducted by GirlScript Foundation intending to help beginners get started with Open Source Development. Throughout the program, participants contribute to different projects under the guidance of mentors and project admins. Top contributors are rewarded goodies and future opportunities.

In 2020, I got to know about this program via LinkedIn but the program was already in running and no new applications were accepted. Then the organizers launched an extended program but it was intended for previously registered students. Though I registered for the extended program, I knew that I won’t be accepted and the result was as expected, not accepted. 

Then I got engaged in other open-source programs such as Hackincodes and Script Winter of Code which gave me enough confidence to directly apply as a Mentor in GSSOC! 

As soon as the applications for mentors were out, I filled it in first hand only and waited for the results. Luckily, I was selected as a Mentor for this year’s GSSOC edition.
