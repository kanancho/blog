What is AI (Artificial Intelligence) and why is everyone in the industry talking about it? It is fast becoming everyone’s favorite buzzword and it is changing almost every aspect of daily life in modernized countries whether you know it or not. Autonomous vehicles, robotics, customer service, utilities; all of these areas are retooling for an AI-driven future. 

Artificial Intelligence routines and algorithms are starting to form the backbone of major systems and networks by providing robust analytics and predictions. People are even leveraging AI-driven tools to bring new products and services to the remotest regions and communities. 

AI covers a wide variety of domains from cognitive science to statistics and programming, but a very simple definition would be teaching computers to imitate (and eventually replicate) human intelligence.


Let’s look at some of the extended uses of AI:

## 1. AI for Graphic Designers

Adobe’s new AI tool Sensei facilitate designers in image pattern identification by editing, patching an image or reinventing a specific test case. Context-Aware Crop ensures prevention of accidental cropping of a test image. We also know about Netflix’s automatic translation that expedites content localization with high accuracy. Multiple banner or layout options can be created by robots in different languages. The designer only needs to verify them and approve it. Airbnb’s AI can in real-time identify and convert paper sketches created by designers into codes which is freeking amazing! Auto Draw is another automated visual component that can finish and fine-tune your sketches into fresh and polished versions within no time. More a designer engages with machine learning tools for drawing sketches, the more effectively AI can comprehend what the users are trying to draw on the basis on previous iterations. In 2014, The Grid launched its crowdfunding campaign with an AI named Molly, capable of allowing websites to design themselves in stipulated timeline. One of the preliminary entries into the AI website design marketplace, Molly is a quantum leap which has built innumerable websites at competitive rates and with unmissed deadlines.


## 2. AI for music

MuseNet, a deep neural network which will generate 4-minute musical compositions with ten totally different instruments, and might mix designs from country to Mozart to the rock band. MuseNet wasn't expressly programmed with our understanding of music, however instead discovered patterns of harmony, rhythm, and elegance by learning to predict future token in many thousands of MIDI files. MuseNet uses constant all-purpose unsupervised technology as GPT-2, a large-scale electrical device model trained to predict future token in a very sequence, whether or not audio or text. 

Take, for example, a bit by Mozart. If the model solely attended to some seconds at a time, it'd ne'er be ready to learn the larger musical structures of a symphony because it grew and receded, switched tones and instruments. however, the model was given enough virtual brain space to carry onto regarding four full minutes of sound, over enough to know one thing sort of a slow begin to an enormous end, or a basic verse-chorus-verse structure.

## 3. AI in Content writing

Wordsmith, automated Insights' technology is already getting used by firms just like the Associated Press and Yahoo to autogenerate data-heavy articles concerning quarterly earnings, school sports, and even fantasy soccer recaps. Today, the corporate is unveiling a public-facing version of its author platform for anyone to use. You can sign up for access to the beta, with general availability being planned for some time in January.

The author platform is meant to mechanically generate language reports supported massive knowledge sets. Within every project (defined by the info set, uploaded as a CSV file), you'll be able to produce multiple "narratives," that square measure in an exceedingly sense high-powered Mad Libs. Write the basic structure, swapping key words for the variables available, and then add logic.


## 4. AI Video generation

Deepfake is associate AI-based technology that turn out or alter video content in order that it presents one thing that did not, in fact, occur. The term is named for a Reddit user known as deepfakes who, in December 2017, used deep learning technology to edit the faces of celebrities onto people in pornographic video clips. The term, which applies to both the technologies and the videos created with it, is a portmanteau of deep learning and fake. 

Deepfake video is created by using two competing AI systems -- one is called the generator and the other is called the discriminator. Basically, the generator creates a fake video clip and then asks the discriminator to determine whether the clip is real or fake. Each time the soul accurately identifies a video clip as being faux, it offers the generator a clue concerning what to not do once making ensuing clip. Together, the generator and discriminator form something called a generative adversarial network (GAN). The first step in establishing a GAN is to identify the desired output and create a training dataset for the generator. Once the generator begins creating an acceptable level of output, video clips can be fed to the discriminator. As the generator gets better at creating fake video clips, the discriminator gets better at spotting them. Conversely, as the discriminator gets better at spotting fake video, the generator gets better at creating them.


So this was all about new AI trends that are blooming in the today's world. I hope you are liking my way of writing. Peace!
