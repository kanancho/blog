Industrial visit has its importance in the career of a student who is pursuing a professional degree (B. Tech in our case). It is considered as a part of the college curriculum and objectives of the industrial visit is to provide students an insight regarding the internal working of companies, how things work at back-end and implementing what has been taught. We know, theoretical knowledge is not enough for making a good professional career until we know the real-life scenario. Intending to go beyond academics, industrial visit provides the student a practical perspective in the world of work.

Following the same lines, students of Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology (MAIT), Rohini visited Network Bulls, a leading CISCO training institute and Doordarshan Kendra, Todapur. Our class was divided into two half, one half went to Network Bulls and other to Doordarshan Kendra. I went to Network Bulls coordinated under Mr. Bhaskar Kapoor and Mr. Ajay Kaushik and I will give you a virtual tour of how it went. Doordarshan experience is shared by Shubham Singla and Ayushi Jain after mine which was coordinated under Dr. Neha Aggarwal and Ms. Mennu Garg.

Network Bulls, Gurgaon has a strategic location because of its proximity to the metro. When we reached the venue, we proceeded to the seminar class. The aim of the visit was Networking Concepts, and it covered a variety of topics like what is it all about, scope, various hardware components involved, OSI model, IP address assignment and various other sensing topics. The session was given by a certified trainer who not only taught the theoretical aspects of networking but encouraged and guided us on how to proceed with our goals, how to stay motivated, how to tackle interviews and a lot more learning.

Technically, we were taught how data traverses from one end to another, working on switches, routers, the importance of IP address. We were also taught how data passes through each layer of OSI model (7-layer model which includes application layer, presentation layer, session layer, transport layer, network layer, data-link layer & physical layer) and changes at each level like encryption at the presentation layer, establishing a session with other end, creating small chunks of data, including TCP/IP or UDP protocol headers and finally creating a packet. IP addresses were discussed, who assign them, how they are created, types of IP address (classes). MAC addresses were also discussed.

After this heavy theoretical session, we were sent to networking labs where the actual work takes place. All the networking components were present there ranging from servers, switches, routers and other components which form a network. We were demonstrated how to form a LAN connection and set up a DHCP connection manually. The trainer also gave us insights into CCCIE and CCNA certifications in cybersecurity and network engineer.

Another visit was Doordarshan Kendra, Todapur.

> As soon as our team reached the venue, we proceeded to the conference hall where the instructor told us about the signal processing, how a signal is sent from the ground station, how it is amplified using a multiplexer and de-multiplexer - Shubham Singla

> I had a great learning experience. Though the whole visit was centered on communication topics like television, radio signals, and other communication stuff but it was great knowing new things. I learned new terminologies like cband, kV band and lots of new stuff. Overall, it was a great learning source - Ayushi Jain

So, this was a short description of what happened in both the visits. I hope I could describe both of them as precisely I can.
