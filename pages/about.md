Hi, 

Myself Kaustubh Gupta, undergrad from India. I write about both tech and non-tech things. 

I am a Python Developer capable of Web Scraping, Automations, Data Science, a bit of Backend Web Development with knowledge of CSS and Bootstrap, Android App Developer in Python. 

I explore everything that can use Python. I am currently mastering Machine learning algorithms along with real-world applications involving a mixture of all tech stacks.

Crossed over 250k+ views on Medium, writing is my current hobby. I have written over 130+ articles for companies as a freelancer, personal blogs for my website, and medium blogs for publications. I usually listen to jazz music while working.

Do check out my projects and star them if you find them useful ðŸ˜ƒ

Thanks!
